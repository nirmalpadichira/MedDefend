##### Attacks are generated using torchattacks package. The attack parameters can be varied to change the attack strength.#############

!pip install torchattacks
import torchattacks
# Define the PGD attack parameters
epsilon = 0.035  # Maximum perturbation
alpha = epsilon / 10  # Step size
steps = 80  # Number of steps

# Define the PGD attack
attack_PGD = torchattacks.PGD(model, eps=epsilon, alpha=alpha, steps=steps)

from torchattacks import CW
cw_attack = CW(model, c=1e-4, kappa=0, steps=100, lr=0.01)

from torchattacks import DeepFool
# Define the BIM attack with the desired parameters
bim_attack = torchattacks.BIM(model, eps=0.1, alpha=0.01, steps=10)

# Initialize the Deep Fool attack
deep_fool_attack = DeepFool(model, steps=60, overshoot=0.04)

fgsm_attack = torchattacks.FGSM(model, eps=0.3)

### You can generate and save the attacked images corresponding to the original image from the datset, but it requires a lot of storage space. To avoid that, you can generate attack on the 
go within the main loop and obtain P_1&P_2 corresponding to each attack without saving the generated images######################
